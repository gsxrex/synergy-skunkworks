# synergy-skunkworks
This repository holds different projects that target Renesas Synergy
microcontrollers and the Synergy software package.


Unless noted in the git log or the inclusion of IAR Embedded Workbench files, 
these projects work under the e2 studio IDE. There shouldn't be anything
specific that precludes you from using it in IAR, it's just that nobody has
taken the time to move everything over and try it out.
